Yes, your understanding is correct!

Here’s a recap with a bit more clarity on the flow:

1. **Separate `httpx.post` Requests** in each Streamlit function created a new, independent HTTP request each time, but **session data was preserved** across requests because:
   - Each endpoint had the `authenticate_api_key` dependency, which injected `company_name` into the session upon authentication.
   - As long as the session cookie was maintained by the client (e.g., Streamlit’s `httpx.Client` instance), each subsequent request could access the `company_name` in the session.

2. **Lack of `authenticate_api_key` Dependency in `start_batch_processing`**:
   - Since `start_batch_processing` did not have `authenticate_api_key` as a dependency, it did not automatically check for or re-inject session data like `company_name`.
   - Without this dependency, `start_batch_processing` could not access the `company_name` from the session, resulting in the `400` error (`Company name not found in session`).

3. **Adding the Dependency Solves the Issue**:
   - By adding `authenticate_api_key` as a dependency in `start_batch_processing`, you ensure that every time `start_batch_processing` is called, the `company_name` (and any other session information) is verified and available in the session.

So, to summarize: your understanding is spot on. The missing dependency was the reason `start_batch_processing` couldn’t access `company_name` in the session. Adding the dependency makes `start_batch_processing` work as expected.
