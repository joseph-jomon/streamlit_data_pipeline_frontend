If we're looking to handle long-running requests in a more **robust and professional** way, we should take into account not just the timeout, but also other factors such as **retrying failed requests**, **progress tracking**, and **handling partial responses**. Here's a more comprehensive approach:

### Professional Approach:
1. **Increase Timeout**: Keep the custom timeout but ensure itâ€™s applied effectively.
2. **Retry on Failure**: Implement retries for transient failures (e.g., network blips or temporary unavailability).
3. **Exponential Backoff**: Use an exponential backoff strategy for retrying to avoid hammering the server in case of failure.
4. **Progress Indicator**: Provide feedback to the user, especially for long-running tasks.
5. **Asynchronous Requests**: If your API and app are suited for async execution, you can use `httpx.AsyncClient` for non-blocking requests.

### Updated Code with Professional Enhancements

```python
import httpx
import streamlit as st
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000/flowfact"

# Retry decorator with exponential backoff (e.g., 3 retries with exponential wait)
@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=30))
def fetch_data(api_key):
    try:
        # Use a custom timeout directly in the get() method
        response = httpx.get(f"{BASE_URL}/fetch-data/", 
                             params={"api_key": api_key}, 
                             timeout=120.0)  # Timeout set to 120 seconds
        
        # Check if the response is successful
        if response.status_code == 200:
            st.json(response.json())  # Display the fetched data in JSON format
        else:
            st.error(f"Failed to fetch data. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    except httpx.TimeoutException:
        st.error("Error: The request timed out. Retrying...")
        raise  # Raise the exception to trigger the retry mechanism
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        raise  # Raise the exception if we want to retry

# Validate images function with similar retry mechanism
@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=30))
def validate_images(api_key):
    try:
        # Use a custom timeout directly in the post() method
        response = httpx.post(f"{BASE_URL}/validate-images/", 
                              params={"api_key": api_key}, 
                              timeout=120.0)  # Timeout set to 120 seconds
        
        # Check if the response is successful
        if response.status_code == 200:
            st.json(response.json())  # Display the invalid images, if any
        else:
            st.error(f"Failed to validate images. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    except httpx.TimeoutException:
        st.error("Error: The request timed out. Retrying...")
        raise  # Raise the exception to trigger the retry mechanism
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        raise  # Raise the exception if we want to retry
```

### Key Professional Features Added:

#### 1. **Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff**:
   - Using the `tenacity` library, which allows retrying failed requests with customizable strategies (like retries, wait times, and backoff).
   - In this example:
     - The function will retry up to **3 times** (`stop_after_attempt(3)`).
     - The waiting time between retries follows an **exponential backoff** strategy (`wait_exponential`) starting at 4 seconds and increasing to a maximum of 30 seconds.
   - This prevents overloading the API with requests if it is temporarily down or experiencing latency.

#### 2. **Timeout Handling**:
   - We maintain a **120-second timeout** but handle **timeouts gracefully** by informing the user of the retry attempts.

#### 3. **Progress Indicator**:
   - You can add a `st.spinner()` in the `Streamlit` app to visually indicate progress, which will show while the data is being fetched or images are being validated.

#### 4. **Error Propagation**:
   - If a transient error (such as a timeout) occurs, the code retries. However, if an irrecoverable error occurs, it logs the issue and stops retrying.

### How This Improves Robustness:

- **More Robust Failures**: If a request fails due to temporary issues (network latency, server timeout, etc.), the retry mechanism ensures the system will keep trying until it reaches the retry limit.
- **Backoff Strategy**: The exponential backoff reduces the risk of overwhelming the API or getting rate-limited.
- **Improved UX**: Users receive feedback about what's happening (e.g., retries, errors) and don't experience a silent failure.

### Asynchronous Approach (Optional):

If your API supports asynchronous requests and you want to make your app non-blocking, you can refactor the code using `httpx.AsyncClient` for asynchronous execution.

```python
import httpx
import streamlit as st
import asyncio
from tenacity import retry, stop_after_attempt, wait_exponential

BASE_URL = "http://localhost:8000/flowfact"

# Async fetch data function with retry and backoff
@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=30))
async def fetch_data_async(api_key):
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            # Async GET request with timeout
            response = await client.get(f"{BASE_URL}/fetch-data/", 
                                        params={"api_key": api_key}, 
                                        timeout=120.0)  # Timeout set to 120 seconds

            if response.status_code == 200:
                st.json(response.json())  # Display the fetched data
            else:
                st.error(f"Failed to fetch data. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    except httpx.TimeoutException:
        st.error("Error: The request timed out. Retrying...")
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        raise

# Async validate images function
@retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=4, max=30))
async def validate_images_async(api_key):
    try:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            # Async POST request with timeout
            response = await client.post(f"{BASE_URL}/validate-images/", 
                                         params={"api_key": api_key}, 
                                         timeout=120.0)  # Timeout set to 120 seconds
            
            if response.status_code == 200:
                st.json(response.json())  # Display the invalid images
            else:
                st.error(f"Failed to validate images. Status code: {response.status_code}")
    except httpx.TimeoutException:
        st.error("Error: The request timed out. Retrying...")
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

To call these async functions in the Streamlit app, use `asyncio.run()`:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Final Thoughts:

- **For synchronous execution**, using a retry mechanism with exponential backoff and handling timeouts professionally ensures a robust API interaction.
- **For non-blocking apps**, adopting the asynchronous approach with `httpx.AsyncClient` would improve performance, especially when dealing with long-running operations.

Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the async approach or if the retry and timeout strategy resolves the issue!
