The error message `OSError: [Errno 28] No space left on device` indicates that the disk where the Docker container is running has run out of available space. Restarting the container with `docker compose down` and then starting it again will not resolve this issue since it is related to disk usage, not a container state issue.

Here’s how you can address it:

### 1. **Check Disk Usage on the Host**

   On the Docker host machine, check for disk usage to confirm that space is actually full:
   ```bash
   df -h
   ```
   Look for the `/var/lib/docker` directory (or whichever directory Docker uses to store data) and verify the usage.

### 2. **Clean Up Docker Resources**

   Often, old containers, images, volumes, or networks consume disk space over time. Here are some ways to clean up:

   - **Remove unused images**:
     ```bash
     docker image prune -a
     ```
   - **Remove unused volumes**:
     ```bash
     docker volume prune
     ```
   - **Remove unused networks**:
     ```bash
     docker network prune
     ```
   - **Remove stopped containers**:
     ```bash
     docker container prune
     ```

   If you want to perform all of the above in one step, you can run:
   ```bash
   docker system prune -a --volumes
   ```
   This command will delete all unused data, so make sure no important stopped containers or volumes are removed.

### 3. **Check Container-Specific Storage**

   If your application is creating files (e.g., large temporary files for model weights or datasets), these may accumulate and fill up the disk. Consider:
   
   - Using ephemeral storage in `/tmp` or deleting temporary files after processing.
   - Mounting a specific host directory to store larger files and ensure they don’t consume all available space.

### 4. **Use a Larger Disk (if applicable)**

   If disk space issues persist and you require more storage, you may need to allocate more disk space on the host machine or consider using additional storage solutions if feasible.

After performing these cleanup steps, try running `docker compose up` again. This should free up the space necessary to avoid the `[Errno 28] No space left on device` error.
