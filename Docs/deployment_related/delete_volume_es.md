To delete data in this case, it’s typically handled outside the container. Here’s how to delete the data directory:

1. **Locate the Data Directory on the Host Machine**:
   - If you configured Docker to mount a volume for Elasticsearch data, it’s likely stored on your host machine at the path you specified. Check your `docker-compose.yml` or `docker run` command for the mount path, often defined as:
     ```yaml
     - ./path/on/host:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data
     ```
   - If the data path is not specified explicitly in the configuration, Docker often stores volumes in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` on the host.

2. **Delete Data on the Host Machine**:
   - Once you locate the data directory on the host (e.g., `./path/on/host`), delete its contents. This can be done with:
     ```bash
     sudo rm -rf /path/to/elasticsearch/data/*
     ```
   - **Important**: Deleting this will erase any existing indices and data stored in Elasticsearch.

3. **Restart Elasticsearch**:
   - After clearing the data directory, restart the container using:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```
   This should start Elasticsearch fresh without the legacy data issues.

By deleting the data directory on the host, you remove the need to access the container directly. This approach is typically required when containers fail to start due to incompatible data formats or configuration issues.
