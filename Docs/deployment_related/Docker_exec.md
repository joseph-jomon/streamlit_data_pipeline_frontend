The `celery events` command can be run either inside the container where Celery is running or on the host machine. However, the setup and connection requirements differ based on where you run it:

### 1. **Running Inside the Container**

Running `celery events` inside the container provides a straightforward way to monitor Celery events if you have access to the container terminal.

1. **Access the Container’s Shell**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <celery_worker_container_name> /bin/bash
   ```
   Replace `<celery_worker_container_name>` with the name of your Celery worker container (e.g., `batch_vectorization_service_monorepo_folder_structure-celery_worker-1`).

2. **Run `celery events`**:
   Inside the container, run:
   ```bash
   celery -A myapp.celery_app events
   ```
   This should display real-time task events in the container's console.

### 2. **Running on the Host Machine**

To run `celery events` from the host, you’ll need to ensure that your host can connect to the same message broker as the Celery worker (Redis in this case). This may require some configuration:

1. **Update Broker Settings (if needed)**:
   Ensure that the Redis server in the container is accessible from the host. This may require exposing the Redis port (6379) in your `docker-compose.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   redis:
     image: redis:alpine
     container_name: redis
     ports:
       - "6379:6379"
   ```

2. **Run `celery events` on the Host**:
   On the host machine, use the same command:
   ```bash
   celery -A myapp.celery_app events --broker=redis://localhost:6379/0
   ```
   Replace `localhost` with the appropriate IP address if Redis is on a different machine.

### **Recommendation**
If you’re already using Docker and want the simplest option, running `celery events` inside the Celery container will avoid additional networking configurations.
